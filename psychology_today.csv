For it is in love that we find the greatest of strengths and the deepest of sorrows. Love can seem to be so fleeting and unachievable, yet it remains well within our reach if we only learn how to embrace its power. To experience true love, we must be willing to open ourselves up and sacrifice part of our heart and part of our soul. We must be willing to give of ourselves freely, and we must be willing to suffer. It is only when we expose our inner selves to the white hot flame of rejection, that love can burn so brightly as to join two souls, melding the two into one, creating a bond that joins forever. It is from this bond that we draw strength eternal and power everlasting. It is in this thing that we call love that we find the means to achieve greatness, both in ourselves and in our lives. ~ AnonymousIn this world of extremes, we can only love too little. ~ Rich CannarellaLove is the word used to label the sexual excitement of the young, the habituation of the middle-aged, and the mutual dependence of the old. ~ John CiardiLove is a canvas furnished by nature and embroidered by imagination. ~ VoltaireIf there is anything better than to be loved it is loving. ~ AnonymousLove built on beauty, soon as beauty, dies. ~ John DonneHe that falls in love with himself will have no rivals. ~ Benjamin FranklinI never knew how to worship until I knew how to love. ~ Henry Ward BeecherWe are all a little weird and life's a little weird, and when we find someone whose weirdness is compatible with ours, we join up with them and fall in mutual weirdness, and call it love. ~ AnonymousNo one has ever loved anyone the way everyone wants to be loved. ~ Mignon McLaughlinThe one who loves less controls the relationship. ~ AnonymousIf love is blind, why is lingerie so popular? ~ AnonymousTrue love is when you put someone on a pedestal, and they fall--but you are there to catch them. ~ AnonymousThe woman cries before the wedding, the man after. ~ ProverbPleasure of love lasts but a moment, Pain of love lasts a lifetime. ~ Jean Pierre Claris De FlorianLove won't be tampered with, love won't go away.
